## Introduction

Healthcare infrastructure has faced increasing threats over recent years, especially during the global pandemic. This project focuses on developing a visual analytics workflow to analyze such attacks, helping stakeholders to understand patterns, trends, and impacts of these incidents.

## Workflow Overview

The modified workflow based on Keim's Visual Analytics largely involves the following steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data on attacks on healthcare infrastructure.
2. **Data Processing**: Cleaning and organizing the collected data for analysis.
3. **Visual Analytics**: Applying visual analytics techniques to identify patterns and insights.
4. **Interaction and Refinement**: Allowing users to interact with the data to refine and explore specific aspects.
5. **Knowledge Generation**: Generating actionable insights and knowledge from the data.

## Dataset Source

The data used in this project covers attacks on healthcare infrastructure across the globe for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. The raw data can be found [here](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/shcchealthcare-dataset).

## Results

The project results include detailed visualizations and analyses of attacks on healthcare infrastructure. These visualizations help in understanding the frequency, location, and nature of these attacks, providing valuable insights for policymakers, healthcare providers, and security experts.
